## End-to-End Modular ML Pipeline for Detecting Phishing Websites
This project aims to build a scalable and modular Machine Learning pipeline to detect phishing websites based on network and URL features. The pipeline follows a clean modular structure using component-based architecture for each stage of the ML lifecycle â€” from ingestion to deployment.

The goal is to enable production-ready deployment of phishing detection as an API service, leveraging FastAPI, Docker, Cloud deployment, and CI/CD workflows via GitHub Actions.
